👋 Hi, I’m Amman Butt — a Computer Science graduate with a passion for building practical, human-centered software solutions. After managing teams and responsibilities in the real world, I’ve refocused my energy on what I love most: creating, coding, and solving problems through technology.

💻 I’m currently sharpening my skills in:
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- AI & Machine Learning (Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV)
- Software engineering best practices (version control, testing, clean code)

🚀 I'm especially interested in the intersection of AI and user-focused applications — chatbots, automation tools, and data-driven platforms.

🌍 Originally from Pakistan, now based in the U.S., I bring a global perspective, real-life leadership experience, and a relentless drive to keep learning.

🔧 Tools I use: VS Code, Git, GitHub, Postman, Figma, Jupyter, Linux

📂 Check out my pinned projects below for hands-on examples of what I’m working on.

📫 Let’s connect! Feel free to reach out or collaborate on open-source or AI-driven projects.
